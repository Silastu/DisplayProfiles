Save multi monitor configurations of Windows 7 and easily switch between them with a click in a popup menu of your taskbar.

The tool is designed for users with two or more monitors who in certain situations would like to quickly change their monitor setup for performing a certain tasks (e.g. enable/disable a TV which is attached to the HDMI port, make an attached TV the primary display to get rid of tearing problems, switch which monitor is on the left/right...).

The program works by saving a current monitor setup as configured using the windows control panel to an xml file. Once saved the configuration can be quickly restored at any time. Requires .NET 4.0 Framework to be installed.

The program is quite simple and in an early development stage. It is provided without any warranty. If you accidentally disable all your monitors boot into safe mode to fix the problem.
